# Grailed Price History (WIP)
This is a very messy repo right now, due to the very non-linear progression that this project has taken.

The main part I am working on right now is in `src > index.html` (and linked JS/CSS), which is a simple dashboard to present data from Grailed listings.

All the files in the `docs` folder are from before I found Grailed's second API, and some from before I had found or knew of *any* API, so they are mostly obsolete for now. I do plan to come back to them for a search function using their api search which is done through an Algolia API.
