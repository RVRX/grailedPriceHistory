# Grailed Price History (WIP)
This is a very messy repo right now, due to the very non-linear progression that this project has taken.

The main dashboard is now *operational*, see [https://rvrx.github.io/grailedPriceHistory/](https://rvrx.github.io/grailedPriceHistory/)

Next I plan to get back to working on the backend Python scripts to scrape data off the site, but switching from using the old headless webscraper method I was using, to pulling data from the Algolia API that I found looking through Grailed's network requests.

**Note** that many files in this repo are from before I found Grailed's second API, and some from before I had found or knew of *any* API, so they are mostly obsolete for now. I do plan to come back to them for a search function using their api search which is done through an Algolia API.

Planned Addition: Price deltas, see price difference between drops (e.g. User wants to know by how much the seller typically drops the price).
