# Grailed Price History (WIP)
This was my initial repo for my grailed.com projects, where I was doing some research on their site and trying to figure out how to scrape it. The end result was the dashboard at [https://rvrx.github.io/grailedPriceHistory/](https://rvrx.github.io/grailedPriceHistory/), and led to my [other projects](https://github.com/search?q=user%3ARVRX+grailed) centered on grailed. This repo, is a large mess of many different iterations of many different things. In its contents there are multiple attempts at Python scrapers using different frameworks, different files with cURL requests where I was trying to download the JSON result of thier Algolia API, to some of my earlier JS files to add all listings to "my grails" (liked listings) to scrape through email updates from grailed. All-in-all I want to keep this repo here to look back on, but am arching it as I see no point in expending the effort it would take to make this a legible project.

~~This is a very messy repo right now, due to the very non-linear progression that this project has taken.~~

~~The main dashboard is now *operational*, see [https://rvrx.github.io/grailedPriceHistory/](https://rvrx.github.io/grailedPriceHistory/)~~

~~Next I plan to get back to working on the backend Python scripts to scrape data off the site, but switching from using the old headless webscraper method I was using, to pulling data from the Algolia API that I found looking through Grailed's network requests.~~

~~**Note** that many files in this repo are from before I found Grailed's second API, and some from before I had found or knew of *any* API, so they are mostly obsolete for now. I do plan to come back to them for a search function using their api search which is done through an Algolia API.~~

~~Planned Addition: Price deltas, see price difference between drops (e.g. User wants to know by how much the seller typically drops the price).~~
